  * John here. Not my code. Here's the forum post with the cool dude who did it: 
  * https://forum.processing.org/one/topic/how-to-generate-a-simple-waveform-of-an-entire-sound-file.html
  * This sketch demonstrates two ways to accomplish offline (non-realtime) analysis of an audio file.<br>
  * The first method, which uses an AudioSample, is what you see running.<br>
  * The second method, which uses an AudioRecordingStream and is only available in Minim Beta 2.1.0 and beyond,<br>
  * can be viewed by looking at the offlineAnalysis.pde file.
